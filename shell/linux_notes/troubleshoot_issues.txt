
app troubleshooting:

  check the open files ( lsof ) if app running out of open files
  check for tcp connections if app running out out of tcpconnections ( netstat -tulpan | grep port )
  check for tcp connections to database  ( netstat -tulpan | grep port ) 
  check if database connections are multi threaded 

check app specific logs ..

check /var/log/messages..

Issue with running command remotely with ssh:

Below command works but hangs at the end without returning the prompt, ssh session will hang until killed.
       ( here STDERR redirected to STDOUT )
   ssh devctlvveoacc01 "rpm -Uvh /var/tmp/bpa_temp/tda-capmgt-bpa-10.5.00-1.x86_64.rpm 2>&1"

But below works: it returns the prompt ( here STDOUT redirected to STDERR )
  ssh devctlvveoams01 "rpm -Uvh /var/tmp/bpa_temp/tda-capmgt-bpa-10.5.00-1.x86_64.rpm 1>&2"

Answer: It seems some issue with STDERR and it is causing the hang, once stdout is redircted to it it is fine
