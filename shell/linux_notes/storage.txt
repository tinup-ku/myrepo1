SAN
Can be added to servers as a disk and replicate to other location on raw level
there are also ways to connect to SAN using multipath if more fault tolerance is required for HA databases

VMWare scans the disk and add as the virtual disk to the server
Linux can add it as LVM


Disk can be added as raw disk e.g. for Oracle and not visible to "df" and "lvm"
only fdisk can show the disk data

LVM on EMC SAN SRDF

Once disk is presented by the hardware (EMC) to the system, LVM can be used for disk management.
SRDF is the storage based replciation from R1 to R2. r1 => r2 can be replcaited to a block device which can be mounted on the HOST side(LVM control) for DR purpose
