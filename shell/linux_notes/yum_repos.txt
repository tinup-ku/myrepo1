  ===================
Steps:

Download the repo file in  /etc/yum.repos.d/ from vendor

Install a web server such as apache/lighttpd on the machine that hosts the RPMs

Install packages
  sudo yum install yum-utils createrepo

Download the yum repository into a temporary location
  reposync -r cloudera-cdh5 
 

     ---------
Put all the RPMs into a directory served by your web server, such as   /var/www/html/apprepo/RPMS

Make sure you can curl to this:
  http://<yourwebserver>/apprepo/RPMS
   ------------
   or if you want to serve from any other dir like - /app/apprepo
    create a apache alias for it- 
    cat /etc/httpd/conf.d/repo.conf
    Alias /puppetrepo "/app/puppet5"
   ------------

Run this in the dir where all rpm's are available:
  createrepo .

Edit the repo file you downloaded in step 1 and replace the line starting with baseurl= or mirrorlist= with baseurl=http://<yourwebserver>/apprepo/RPMS
 Save the file back to /etc/yum.repos.d/.

chech the local repo with "yum repolist "
and

[root@devctlvpptapp01 ~]# curl http://localhost/puppetrepo/repodata/repomd.xml
