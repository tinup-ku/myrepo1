troubleshooting bash script:

if script works from command line but not from cron , it may be environemtn issue.
you can get logs like below

Assign log dir:

sdate=`date +%F`
logfile="/var/tmp/bkup_log.$sdate"

redirect all stdin/stderr to logfile and put script in debug mode:
exec 1>>$logfile
exec 2>&1

set -xv
