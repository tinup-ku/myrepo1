1 -query the REST API to get the list of jobs running and their SID

see http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.5.0/RESTTUT/RESTsearches

2 - find the ones you want to terminate

3 - call the job termination REST API endpoint for this job SID.
http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.5.0/RESTREF/RESTsearch#search.2Fjobs.2F.7Bsearch_id.7D...

example with curl to finalize job "mysearch_02151949"

 curl -k -u admin:pass https://localhost:8089/services/search/jobs/mysearch_02151949/control -d action=finalize
Remark : If you want to script , you can use the SDK to interact with the API

Yes, there is a REST command to stop a running search.

Use this command to get a list of searches back:

curl -k -u admin:<pwd> https://localhost:8089/services/search/jobs/ | grep '<id>'
You can use the `` URL to cancel/delete this search like this:

curl -k -u admin:<pwd> --request DELETE https://localhost:8089/services/search/jobs/1416293763.77
and get back a response like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<response>
  <messages>
    <msg type="INFO">Search job cancelled.</msg>
  </messages>
</response>
For more details have a look at the docs http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.2.0/RESTREF/RESTsearchExamples#search.2Fjobs.2F.7Bsear...

If you just need a nice table view of the running jobs, you can do this as well from the Splunk UI using this search:

| rest /services/search/jobs/ | table author, id
Hope this helps ...

cheers, MuS

I have the following rest query to identify the current running query for jasper.dang

| rest /services/search/jobs/
| search author=jasper.dang dispatchState=RUNNING
| search NOT id=*scheduler*
| table title id normalizedSearch runDuration

You can try following Rest API, action: cancel . Doc link - Search endpoint descriptions - Splunk Documentation

https://<host>:<mPort>/services/search/jobs/{search_id}/control
curl -k -u admin:pass https://localhost:8089/services/search/jobs/mysearch_02151949/control -d action=pause
