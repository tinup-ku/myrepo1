Steps to delete events in Splunk.

1.    Login as admin on the stand-alone Splunk admin SH

2.    Run the query (without delete) to verify events and counts: index="accountmaintenance" cf_app_name=documentingestion* sourcetype=elilogs "\\"BcsData\\":"

3.    Get confirmation from data owner to proceed.

4.    Run the query again with delete (Splunk team will share and run the Splunk delete queries)

This can only be done on svm0977cdc (delete is disabled on Prod SHC)
